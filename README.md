This Rock Paper Scissors Game is a different way to play the traditional rock paper scissors game. This game has two different versions: the Classic and The Big Bang Theory. The Classic version corresponds to the traditional game of rock paper scissors with three possible choices: the rock hand, the paper hand and the scissors hand. The Big Bang Theory version is inspired in the version presented in the series, which consists in five hypotheses: the rock hand, the paper hand, the scissors hand, the spock hand and the lizard hand.
In this game the user chooses a hand and the computer randomly generates another hand. The user and the computer score is available during the game. After three scores the game is over.
Finally, instructions on how to play the game are available.

The Level 1 corresponds to the traditional game of rock paper scissors with three possible choices: the rock hand, the paper hand and the scissors hand. The second level corresponds to a different version of the traditional game, based on the version of the Big Bang Theory serie, which consists in five hypotheses: the rock hand, the paper hand, the scissors hand, the spock hand and the lizard hand.
In this game the user chooses a hand and the computer randomly generates another hand. The user and the computer score is available during the game.
